# Consciousness And The Brain

Consciousness and the Brain: Deciphering How the Brain Codes Our Thoughts

By Stanislas Dehaene

## Notes
### Review
- some neurons encode "horizontal" lines vs "vertical" lines
  - if unconscious, mismatches of neurons firing is not resolved
  - if conscious, after 120-140ms all neurons in lower layers start to encode "diagonal" for a diagonal line
  - samples, finds agreement, updates lower levels
- unconscious events are only connected if they are at the same time
- unconscious signals get weaker as they travel the brain
- conscious signals get stronger as they travel the brain
  - after 400ms, it has activated large parts of the brain
- All CIA members would update their local reports to match the president's worldview after the president read all the local reports and published the worldview
- No single president, many different executors of consciousness, none always active
- Conscious perception each takes > 500ms
  - eyes started moving toward the correct answer after 70-100ms
- Time we believe the image appeared is 300ms after it actually appeared
- Conscious perceptions block unconscious perceptions
  - Either missed completely or processed after the 500ms
- Babies conscious 3x slower
  - Cables mized + tangled, cable isolated added later (ex: puberty)

### Chapter 1
- When enough brain regions agree they synchronize, bursts of high level activation
  - creates large workspace to keep important data in mind for focusing
  - is not input-output but broadcasting even in full darkness
- Small contrasts on paper has perfect immobility thus the brain fills in to make it a single object and the constrast dissappears
  - contrast dissappears after a while
  - then you move your eyes and it appears again
  - dissappearing = creating objects / error correction of the eyes input
  - reappearing = it's really in the external world so show it
- Rival images into each eye, flash light into one eye and the image in the opposite eye is never seen
- At any time we have countless perceptions fighting for attention
- If images are flashed too quickly we completely miss the second, we see the second if the time between was > 400ms
- All letters even unconscious enter the brain, even deeply processed in the brain to the point of being classified but not registered consciously
  - Only one chunk of information can go through at a time
- Can hear and see at the same time but only adds to a single conscious thought (or fights for a different one and fails)
- Buffer other inputs to process into memory later "yeah I did see that" even if originally unaware
  - We estimate the buffered inputs occured much later than they actually did
  - The longer its buffered the greater chance of being dropped
- For longer tasks (ex: playing chess vs storing a letter we saw) we become completely oblivious to the outside world
- Ex: count the number of basketball passes by people wearing white in 30s. In the middle of the video a gorilla appears but no one sees it
  - **Gorrilla is black but we were focusing on the white wearing people so we ignored the black (noise)**
- We are blind to what we aren't looking for ex: movie swaps out furniture and we don't even notice
- **See the basics first**
  - Radio covered in triangles and squares and we only see the triangles and squares but not the letters
  - We can't see "radio" even if we're trying
- Cannot see if only 40ms, can see if 60ms
- if "radio" was short enough and the mask was long enough we only see the mask
  - "radio" is disregarded by the brain since the brain is weighing the evidence of what it saw and "radio" didn't have enough
- We think we recognize a word "as a whole" but actually we're doing independent letters/shapes based analysis that we're unaware of and putting the pieces together
- Out of body experiences can be triggered using stimulation
  - Patients with anesthesia, put pictures on top of cabinents that can only be seen from above. Patients think they had an out of body experience viewing from above but they don't see the pictures

### Chapter 2
- reflex arc, unconscious written images affect us
  - automatic reflexes make decisions subconsciously (walking, becoming agry and wanting revenge)
  - Many desires (like a baby wanting milk) is inaccessible to introspection)
- Virtually all of the brain can take place in conscious or unconscious thought
- Ammonesia patient procked with pin when stacking his hand, the next day she forgot about that but she still refused to shake his hand
- conscious vision pathway damaged but unconscious in tact resulting in reflexes to sight working while unaware of seeing anything
- RADIO-radio primes recognition speed as much as radio-radio while house-radio does not
- ranger-anger does not prime recognition speed thus order matters, it's not just a single convolution loop or a nearest neighbor search but instead a recognition process
- **We don't see the world as pixels but as a highly processed representation**
  - We take into account 3D, subconscious shadow removal, focusing, using memory/context all connecting subconsciously
- checkerbox shadow, the dark tile in light looks really dark, the light tile in the shadow looks light but they are the same color
  - the brain parses the scene into objects, sees the shadow and subtracts the shadow from the image, letting you see the true colors of the object without the shadow
- Only expert chess players can evaluate a chessboard and remember its configuration because they automatically parse it into meaningful chunks
  - This is a trained ability
  - Simpler game can be flashed for only 20ms and it still influences the expert's decision
- If someone says "da" but their mouth says "ga" we think they said "ga"
- New words/phrases require conscious attention but overlearned phrases can be understood second hand
- A glance at each word is enough to place it within the overall structure of the story/paragraph
- The brain unconsciously processes all possible meanings of words and consciously attends to one at a time (or drops some)
- Priming effect of emotionally similar words did not help people who saw both words
  - However "tumor" primed "tulip" to be positive which would hint that either it's not priming by meaning or that "tumor" didn't make it far enough to override "tulip" from being positive
- "four" primes strongly 4 for asking if the number is less than five
  - "three" primes 4 less so
  - "two" primes 4 even more less so and so on
  - This is evidence that the brain primes meaning
- Hidden flashed words caused an unconscious emotional dip (takes > 0.5s)
- N400 brain wave is large for a large degree of absurdity of the words in a sentence (unexpected words together in a sentense creates a large N400). This too can be triggered by flashing words not picked up consciously
- Unconscious words are not as influential as conscious ones
- Consciousness requires attention but attention does not require consciousness. We unconsciously decide what information should be alerted to the conscious level
  - Flashing light unconsciously makes you more attentive in that location
  - A hidden picture slows you down if it is irrelevant to the task at hand
    - A conscious distractor can be voluntarily extinguished negating the slow down
- Bottom-up input to brain process of the mind shattered this consensus
  - "radio" priming "radio" depends on how much attention is allocated to that stimuli
    - Thus the top (conscious) partly allocates how much attention the lower levels can allocate
    - Both the high level and lower levels amplify attention
- You can interpret a noisy audio recording after hearing the answer but not before
