# Consciousness And The Brain

Consciousness and the Brain: Deciphering How the Brain Codes Our Thoughts

By Stanislas Dehaene

## Notes
### Review
- some neurons encode "horizontal" lines vs "vertical" lines
  - if unconscious, mismatches of neurons firing is not resolved
  - if conscious, after 120-140ms all neurons in lower layers start to encode "diagonal" for a diagonal line
  - samples, finds agreement, updates lower levels
- unconscious events are only connected if they are at the same time
- unconscious signals get weaker as they travel the brain
- conscious signals get stronger as they travel the brain
  - after 400ms, it has activated large parts of the brain
- All CIA members would update their local reports to match the president's worldview after the president read all the local reports and published the worldview
- No single president, many different executors of consciousness, none always active
- Conscious perception each takes > 500ms
  - eyes started moving toward the correct answer after 70-100ms
- Time we believe the image appeared is 300ms after it actually appeared
- Conscious perceptions block unconscious perceptions
  - Either missed completely or processed after the 500ms
- Babies conscious 3x slower
  - Cables mized + tangled, cable isolated added later (ex: puberty)

### Chapter 1
- When enough brain regions agree they synchronize, bursts of high level activation
  - creates large workspace to keep important data in mind for focusing
  - is not input-output but broadcasting even in full darkness
- Small contrasts on paper has perfect immobility thus the brain fills in to make it a single object and the constrast dissappears
  - contrast dissappears after a while
  - then you move your eyes and it appears again
  - dissappearing = creating objects / error correction of the eyes input
  - reappearing = it's really in the external world so show it
- Rival images into each eye, flash light into one eye and the image in the opposite eye is never seen
- At any time we have countless perceptions fighting for attention
- If images are flashed too quickly we completely miss the second, we see the second if the time between was > 400ms
- All letters even unconscious enter the brain, even deeply processed in the brain to the point of being classified but not registered consciously
  - Only one chunk of information can go through at a time
- Can hear and see at the same time but only adds to a single conscious thought (or fights for a different one and fails)
- Buffer other inputs to process into memory later "yeah I did see that" even if originally unaware
  - We estimate the buffered inputs occured much later than they actually did
  - The longer its buffered the greater chance of being dropped
- For longer tasks (ex: playing chess vs storing a letter we saw) we become completely oblivious to the outside world
- Ex: count the number of basketball passes by people wearing white in 30s. In the middle of the video a gorilla appears but no one sees it
  - **Gorrilla is black but we were focusing on the white wearing people so we ignored the black (noise)**
- We are blind to what we aren't looking for ex: movie swaps out furniture and we don't even notice
- **See the basics first**
  - Radio covered in triangles and squares and we only see the triangles and squares but not the letters
  - We can't see "radio" even if we're trying
- Cannot see if only 40ms, can see if 60ms
- if "radio" was short enough and the mask was long enough we only see the mask
  - "radio" is disregarded by the brain since the brain is weighing the evidence of what it saw and "radio" didn't have enough
- We think we recognize a word "as a whole" but actually we're doing independent letters/shapes based analysis that we're unaware of and putting the pieces together
- Out of body experiences can be triggered using stimulation
  - Patients with anesthesia, put pictures on top of cabinents that can only be seen from above. Patients think they had an out of body experience viewing from above but they don't see the pictures

### Chapter 2
- reflex arc, unconscious written images affect us
  - automatic reflexes make decisions subconsciously (walking, becoming agry and wanting revenge)
  - Many desires (like a baby wanting milk) is inaccessible to introspection)
- Virtually all of the brain can take place in conscious or unconscious thought
- Ammonesia patient procked with pin when stacking his hand, the next day she forgot about that but she still refused to shake his hand
- conscious vision pathway damaged but unconscious in tact resulting in reflexes to sight working while unaware of seeing anything
- RADIO-radio primes recognition speed as much as radio-radio while house-radio does not
- ranger-anger does not prime recognition speed thus order matters, it's not just a single convolution loop or a nearest neighbor search but instead a recognition process
- **We don't see the world as pixels but as a highly processed representation**
  - We take into account 3D, subconscious shadow removal, focusing, using memory/context all connecting subconsciously
- checkerbox shadow, the dark tile in light looks really dark, the light tile in the shadow looks light but they are the same color
  - the brain parses the scene into objects, sees the shadow and subtracts the shadow from the image, letting you see the true colors of the object without the shadow
- Only expert chess players can evaluate a chessboard and remember its configuration because they automatically parse it into meaningful chunks
  - This is a trained ability
  - Simpler game can be flashed for only 20ms and it still influences the expert's decision
- If someone says "da" but their mouth says "ga" we think they said "ga"
- New words/phrases require conscious attention but overlearned phrases can be understood second hand
- A glance at each word is enough to place it within the overall structure of the story/paragraph
- The brain unconsciously processes all possible meanings of words and consciously attends to one at a time (or drops some)
- Priming effect of emotionally similar words did not help people who saw both words
  - However "tumor" primed "tulip" to be positive which would hint that either it's not priming by meaning or that "tumor" didn't make it far enough to override "tulip" from being positive
- "four" primes strongly 4 for asking if the number is less than five
  - "three" primes 4 less so
  - "two" primes 4 even more less so and so on
  - This is evidence that the brain primes meaning
- Hidden flashed words caused an unconscious emotional dip (takes > 0.5s)
- N400 brain wave is large for a large degree of absurdity of the words in a sentence (unexpected words together in a sentense creates a large N400). This too can be triggered by flashing words not picked up consciously
- Unconscious words are not as influential as conscious ones
- Consciousness requires attention but attention does not require consciousness. We unconsciously decide what information should be alerted to the conscious level
  - Flashing light unconsciously makes you more attentive in that location
  - A hidden picture slows you down if it is irrelevant to the task at hand
    - A conscious distractor can be voluntarily extinguished negating the slow down
- Bottom-up input to brain process of the mind shattered this consensus
  - "radio" priming "radio" depends on how much attention is allocated to that stimuli
    - Thus the top (conscious) partly allocates how much attention the lower levels can allocate
    - Both the high level and lower levels amplify attention
- You can interpret a noisy audio recording after hearing the answer but not before
- Attention assigns a value to each stimulus or potential object of thought
  - Valuation calls upon neural networks within the basal ganglia (base of the brain)
  - This too can operate unsconsciously, even for a symbolic value such as money
  - bassal ganglia attached relevant values to each shape flashed unconsciously
- Unconscious mathematics, like coming up to a solution when you take a break and do something else
- draw from two decks, one advantageous one disavantageous. Before becoming aware of a hunch, their hands begin to sweat before taking a card from the bad deck
- participants to choose a car among 4, then half were distracted and half were told to consciously focus on the original problem. The distracted half picked the best car better (60 percent vs 22 percent)
- unconscious processes excel in assigning values to many items and averaging them to reach a decision vs conscious excels on focusing
- Falling asleep after trying a problem with a unconscious shortcut pattern doubled the probability they would find the hidden shortcut pattern
- Thought that conscious was for controlling operations, avoid automatic responses, task switching and detecting errors but now seen that we can do this unconsciously
  - Ex unconscious "stop" signal occasionally caused the user to stop pressing the bottom without knowing why
- Consciousness solves a problem that the specialized parallel systems of unconsciousness could not
- Only the conscious mind could carefully verify, step by step the discovery of the unconscious mind
  - conscious mind resolves conflicts, organizes memories and prevents the user from walking in two directions at the same time = focus
### Chapter 3
- Conscious information is stable
- Conscious information is sampled (small portion of the immense sensory data stream)
- Conscious information is controlled (careful processes/functions can be serially executed)
- Conscious information is purposeely broadcasted (communicated to other humans)
- army of unconscious workers sifting through piles of data. Conscious executives sitting at the top examining only a brief of the situation slowly makes conscious decisinos
- Below the conscious stage, unconscious processors extract detailed and complete interpretation of the environment as nearly optimal statisticians to calculate the probability that a given property holds true in the outside world
- At some point a dictatorial processes needs to colapse all the uncertainties into a single conscious sample so that we can move on to t+1
- bayesian theory: if someone draws three aces from a deck of fifty-two cards, what is the likelihood that the deck was rigged and comprised more than four aces: reverse inference: inferring the hidden cause given an observation
  - hypthesis is that the brain acts as a bayesian statistician
- **See a plate, a single neuron only perceives a small segment of the ellipse. This information is compatible with a broad variety of shapes and motion patterns. Once neurons start talking to each other they cast their votes and the entire population converges on "plate" that is a "circle" and not a "potato" that is "oval like shape"**
  - Once you eliminate the impossible you are left with the truth
- **Motion detection in the brain**
  - **Each neuron sees a part moving through a peekhole. Take a stick at a 45 degree angle and move it right. Through the peekhole it looks like the stick is moving up and to the right. However combined with all the peekholes to all parts of the stick you can infer that the stick is moving to the right and cannot be moving up**
  - Only a single direction of motion satisfies the contraints of rigid motion (it didn't dissappear and it didn't deform)
  - 100ms to see the motion + 100ms to change their mind and encode the global direction
  - Under anesthesia the loss of consciousness causes them to never encode the global direction (never generates a single coherent interpretation of the outside world)
  - Even though we encoded the global direction we are still aware of the probabilties and able to easy switch to the alternative solution (alternative global direction) especially when we are uncertain
    - Like quantum physics where attending to something causes it to collapse into a state, but not observing causes it to be either
  - **hierarchical reporting up to the conscious level. Just like the FBI analysts report to their boss who writes a report to his boss, ..., to the president and then comes back down the chain again**
  - **Memory**
    - Working Memory: prefrontal neurons implement an active memory. They are still firing long after the picture is gone and continue to fire throught the short-term memory task
      - **Similar to a transformer and RNN: the input i_t5 is transformed into a compact representation by a group of neurons o_t5, now those neurons keeping firing o_t5 while another group of neurons hold on to o_t6. But instead we have a fixed working memory size so we might store o_t5, o_t9 and o_t10 dropping the remainder**
      - We also use working memory for planning. Brain damage to this region causes people to lose their planning abilities
      - **Play a tone before puffing air in a person's eye. If the puff comes immediately after the tone (coincide based training), our reflexes occur unconsciously. However if you add a delay between the tone and the puffing air, our reflexes only occur if we consciously become aware. Elderly people, people with amnesia or distracted people show no reflexes/conditioning)**
- Consciously we are aware of the steps we take using our working memory to solve a problem
  - Ex: 12 * 13 = 12 * 12 + 12 = 144 + 12 = 156
  - However this is slow: the brain must contain a "router" that broadcasts information to and from coroutines/substeps/subfunctinos
- Production system to solve AI
  - contains a database = working memory
  - lots of if-then rules
  - At each step examine whether a rule matches the current state of the working memory
    - if multiple matches then they compete under the prioritizing system
    - winning rule activates and changes the working memory
- Turing machine only captures the conscious but its missing the machine learning paralell unconscious
  - brain computes over entire probability distributions (sampling neuron activations) rather than discrete symbols like a computer does
  - brain has self modifiable organization
  - `n+2 > 5` the brain already started with `n > 5` before receiving all the information vs a computer waits for the entire information then processes. Tests show two step calculations require consciousness whereas the single step `n > 5` can be done unconsciously by flashing
- unconscious generates sophisticated hunches but the conscious follows a ration strategy, step by step. Neural networks generate hunches, but the conscious will be needed to explain/rationalize
- Language as a conscious "brief". Compresseed and transmitted
  - The receiver wants a summary of the aspects that are also true for the receiver. This would not be the case with a fully descriptive picture because our experiences are different
- Within the brain signals should be weighted by that neuron's noise level. Same for combining people's opinions
- Gossip = brain tracking each person's noise level, their reliability
- Social parts of the brain activate both when we reflect on ourselves and when we reflect on others
- human ability for introspecting and social sharing and inspecting others allows us to better use the cascading neuron President report from the CIA analysts
