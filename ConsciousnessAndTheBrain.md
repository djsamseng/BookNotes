# Consciousness And The Brain

Consciousness and the Brain: Deciphering How the Brain Codes Our Thoughts

By Stanislas Dehaene

## Notes
### Summary
- some neurons encode "horizontal" lines vs "vertical" lines
  - if unconscious, mismatches of neurons firing is not resolved
  - if conscious, after 120-140ms all neurons in lower layers start to encode "diagonal" for a diagonal line
  - samples, finds agreement, updates lower levels
- unconscious events are only connected if they are at the same time
- unconscious signals get weaker as they travel the brain
- conscious signals get stronger as they travel the brain
  - after 400ms, it has activated large parts of the brain
- All CIA members would update their local reports to match the president's worldview after the president read all the local reports and published the worldview
- No single president, many different executors of consciousness, none always active
- Conscious perception each takes > 500ms
  - eyes started moving toward the correct answer after 70-100ms
- Time we believe the image appeared is 300ms after it actually appeared
- Conscious perceptions block unconscious perceptions
  - Either missed completely or processed after the 500ms
- Babies conscious 3x slower
  - Cables mized + tangled, cable isolated added later (ex: puberty)

### Chapter 1
- When enough brain regions agree they synchronize, bursts of high level activation
  - creates large workspace to keep important data in mind for focusing
  - is not input-output but broadcasting even in full darkness
- Small contrasts on paper has perfect immobility thus the brain fills in to make it a single object and the constrast dissappears
  - contrast dissappears after a while
  - then you move your eyes and it appears again
  - dissappearing = creating objects / error correction of the eyes input
  - reappearing = it's really in the external world so show it
- Rival images into each eye, flash light into one eye and the image in the opposite eye is never seen
- At any time we have countless perceptions fighting for attention
- If images are flashed too quickly we completely miss the second, we see the second if the time between was > 400ms
- All letters even unconscious enter the brain, even deeply processed in the brain to the point of being classified but not registered consciously
  - Only one chunk of information can go through at a time
- Can hear and see at the same time but only adds to a single conscious thought (or fights for a different one and fails)
- Buffer other inputs to process into memory later "yeah I did see that" even if originally unaware
  - We estimate the buffered inputs occured much later than they actually did
  - The longer its buffered the greater chance of being dropped
- For longer tasks (ex: playing chess vs storing a letter we saw) we become completely oblivious to the outside world
- Ex: count the number of basketball passes by people wearing white in 30s. In the middle of the video a gorilla appears but no one sees it
  - **Gorrilla is black but we were focusing on the white wearing people so we ignored the black (noise)**
- We are blind to what we aren't looking for ex: movie swaps out furniture and we don't even notice
- **See the basics first**
  - Radio covered in triangles and squares and we only see the triangles and squares but not the letters
  - We can't see "radio" even if we're trying
- Cannot see if only 40ms, can see if 60ms
